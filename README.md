# Skyliner

> Universal outlining engine. Generate an outline of any text-based document!

Skyliner is a regular expression based document outlining engine. The goal is to support outlining as many different text-based formats as possible. It was born out of frustration that [Atom-IDE](https://ide.atom.io/) doesn't support half of the file formats I usually work with.

It can be used in 2 ways:

1. Through the command-line interface
2. Via the API

Eventually, the goal is to implement a plugin for Atom.
